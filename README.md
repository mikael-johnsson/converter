# Mickes Converter
If you really need to convert some common day value but don't want:
- To have a really simple way of finding it?
- To find all the values you are looking for?
- The exchange rate to be perfectly accurate?

Then this converter is something for you! Not bad, but absolutely not the best.

## Usage
The user is met with the entire content of the application. The three (as of now) different types of data to convert - volume, mass and currency.

Each type has four different values to convert to each other. Since you can't convert a value to itself, each value can be converted to the remaining three.

The values are: 
<br>
*Volume*

- Liter
- Deciliter
- Gallon
- Cup

*Mass*

- Kilo
- Lbs
- Gram
- Ounce

*Currency*
- USD
- EUR
- GBP
- SEK

As the converting values are hardcoded - no real time updates to currency values are made. The conversion is therefore an estimate.
